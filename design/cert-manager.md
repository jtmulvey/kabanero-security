# Kabanero Security Certificate Manager

## Key Concepts / Background
- As part of the devsecops story for Kabanero, we need to offer an out of the box secure communication between client and Open Liberty server

[High level overview](../design/cert-manager.jpg)

## User stories
- As Champ (architect), I would like to be able to use certificate that manage by the cert-manager.

## As-is

- There is no cert-manager in the Kabanero.

## To-be
- When a Kabanero instance is installed, regardless of the runtime stack in use, we will install the cert-manager https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager


## Main Feature design

- The following are the steps we will automate in order to enable SSL communcation betweent :

### 1) 

### 2)

### 3) 


For phase 2 of this support, we automate the above manual steps
